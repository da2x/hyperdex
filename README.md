> hyperspace search engine

This is the webapp component that performs local lookups in the distributed index
generated by the friendly [spider robot](https://github.com/telamon/hyperspace-indexer).

## Use

[Get beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) then visit:

[hyper://cb8986b2d773e17eaa665c1c3d250757348945ba73bf8f95d3b209b92c307e3a/](hyper://cb8986b2d773e17eaa665c1c3d250757348945ba73bf8f95d3b209b92c307e3a/)

## Development

```bash
yarn && yarn serve
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) using the beaker browser.

## Release

I've written a script that manages a distribution drive
in folder `.hyper_dist/` and conditionally imports only files whose
content truly is different (using md5 hashes metadata)

Releasing a page from build to hyperspace has never been easier:

```bash
yarn build && yarn release
```
Example output:

```bash
Imported 869fad781a55f42a744381814e2955ef build/bundle.css
Imported f184b695cecf669ad1126295dc4c72ae build/bundle.css.map
Imported d16a09e1f126b2ddc971dcbf5d972bb7 build/bundle.js
Imported 3d8b0ef8bb73b917e165e24437daa886 build/bundle.js.map
hyper://cb8986b2d773e17eaa665c1c3d250757348945ba73bf8f95d3b209b92c307e3a @ 15
```

Visit the `hyper://`-URL in beaker then add to addressbook + host and
your local hyper-drive daemon will keep a read-only copy of your
distribution drive.

Need to switch computers for publishing? No prob, just zip + transfer
the `.hyper_dist/` folder to destination. (but make sure to delete it at the source to avoid tree-corruption)

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
